Figure out how to create a settings config that will allow the player to type in a color then transfer that to the text and background color
Best way i can think of is to have a bunch of if statements but that feels ineeffcient at best



Main Menu Class
NPC Class
Object class //For handling things like urns and statues
Build out the create player and load player methods
Add a spell check and common word check to my trigger actions. I think there is a plass called fuzz on the web that does this.
Error Code Class

In player, need an exception to the error check for initalizing on start up.

Create a quest class
Create and NonPlayerCharacter Class


Move the input handler class to the tool class so that tool.read automatically runs through the handle input method
