this is my first big project. I have very little idea of what im doing and I am learning on the go. This is currently undering going a refactoring while I move the project to a winforms application. once that is done (locally on my laptop) I will update here. The story is almost non existent at this point so if you are reading this and interested in some writing dm me. if youre a seasoned programmer please feel free to roast my code (in a friendly manner) im here to improve my skills and learn as much as I can. thank you for the time 😊 🙏
